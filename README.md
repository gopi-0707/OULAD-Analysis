## **Project Overview**  
This project leverages the **Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)** to predict early student dropouts and identify at-risk learners. By applying advanced machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide actionable insights for timely interventions, improving retention and academic outcomes.

## **Key Features**
- **Predictive Modeling**:  
   Developed machine learning models, including **Time Series Forest (TSF)**, **Random Forest (RF)**, and **XGBoost**, for high accuracy in predicting at-risk students.  
   
- **Meta-Modeling**:  
   Combined demographic, behavioral, and assessment data to achieve superior performance metrics.  

- **Class Imbalance Handling**:  
   Applied **SMOTE** to address data imbalance and improve model fairness.  

- **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Time-series data extraction.  
   - Clustering (K-Prototypes, K-Means) for better data segmentation.  
   - Analysis of submission patterns and activity rates.  

- **Results**:  
   - Achieved **92.9% AUC** and **90.9% Recall** on imbalanced datasets.  
   - Enabled targeted interventions for improved student outcomes.
